> Create your own operators in JavaScript

## Introduction


During the Math classes we learned how to define new operators. For example:

#### `(ℝ, ∘), x ∘ y = x + 2y`


This defines `∘` law. For any real numbers *x* and *y*, *x ∘ y* is *x + 2y*. e.g: `2 ∘ 2 = 2 + 4 = 6`.

## Custom operators in JavaScript?


This projects finally bring this feature in the JavaScript world! :-) Using [**esprima**](http://esprima.org/) - which takes JS code and generates the syntax tree for it - and [**escodegen**](https://github.com/Constellation/escodegen) - which does the other direction, generating JS code from the syntax tree esprima spits - we can create new JavaScript operators.

## Example


Having two arrays:

```js
var x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  , y = [3, 5, 6, 1]
  ;
```


we want to find the intersection of them (that is `[1, 3, 5]`).

We can easily create a function `function foo (x, y) { ... }`, but why not create an operator instead?

Then `x ⋂ y` will return the same thing. :-)

## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications *for free*! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:


 - Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:
 - [![Buy me a book][badge_amazon]][amazon]—I love books! I will remember you after years if you buy me one. :grin: :book:
 - [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations]—You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:
 - [![Support me on Patreon][badge_patreon]][patreon]—Set up a recurring monthly donation and you will get interesting news about what I'm doing (things that I don't share with everyone).
 - **Bitcoin**—You can send me bitcoins at this address (or scanning the code below): `1P9BRsmazNQcuyTxEqveUsnf5CERdq35V6`
